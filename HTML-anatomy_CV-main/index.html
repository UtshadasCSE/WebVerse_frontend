    <h4>My Skills</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>App Development</li>
        <p>
            Mobile app developers have significant programming skills, specifically with mobile app 
            languages like JavaScript, C++ and C#. Programming language proficiency can make a developer 
            a more competitive candidate for jobs or projects because it shows they know how to use the languages to create 
            working mobile applications. Although you can gain additional knowledge via education programs, no formal education is 
            necessary to learn most languages. This can allow for more flexibility while you develop your skills.

        </p>
        <li>UI/UX Design</li>
        <p>
            UX designers need to be able to collect quantitative as well 
            as qualitative data about users via thorough research and analysis. 
            They can use user interviews, user observation, or testing for the same. They can also 
            conduct surveys or focus groups. UX designers need to know how to choose participants for a focus 
            group and be able to gather reports from unstructured discussions. They also need to know how to come up with 
            open-ended survey questions to make sure they do not lead the users in any which way. UX designers also need to possess 
            decent knowledge of usability test methods.
